in area 40 . in addition , there are plural axially extending ribs 46 , each of which includes a lead - in area 44 . the ribs 46 are spaced apart by axially extending grooves 48 . the ribs 46 snugly engage the outer diameter 49 of the axle shaft shown as 50 , by engaging a portion 52 thereof which is of intermediate size , being slightly larger in diameter than the axially inner portion 53 of the shaft and smaller size than the portion 54 engaging the inside diameter 56 of the bearing generally designated 58 . the bearing 58 is shown to include roller elements 60 , and an outer retainer 64 . the actual type of bearing may vary , and , for example , may feature the rollers 60 indirectly engaging the shaft , or being free from a bearing cage or other locator . oil may pass axially through the grooves 48 in the tone ring 18 from the differential ( not shown ) to the bearings 58 and to the seal generally designated 66 . although not a necessary part of the invention , the seal 66 is shown typically to include a casing or stamping 68 and a rubber primary lip 70 . the seal is shown with an auxiliary or dirt lip 71 as is typical with vehicle axles , but this is not strictly necessary . the tone ring body 18 does not move measurably axially once it is finally installed in the appropriate position over a portion 52 of the shaft 50 . in addition to being held by the friction of the ribs 46 , the body 18 is also held in a final axial position by a tone ring retainer generally designated 75 . preferably , but not necessarily , the retainer generally designated 75 is made from two components , a thicker gauge radially outer indented casing generally designated 76 and a thinner gauge radially inner casing generally designated 78 . the radially inner casing 78 includes an axially extending portion 80 and a radially inwardly extending retaining flange 82 , while the outer casing generally designated 75 , into which the inner , thinner casing 80 is pressed , includes a radially inwardly extending retainer flange 83 , a generally axially extending portion 84 which includes a corrugated exterior surface portion generally designated 88 . thus , the portion of the casing generally designated 88 in","referring now to fig1 of the drawings , the numeral 10 identifies a position in which a trainee with his eyepoint at e in a simulator would view a scene , the center of which is indicated at point a along the line ae . the scene being viewed is a collimated visual image for viewing by at least one trainee , and the center of this scene , point a , is reflected from a spherical mirror 11 . the spherical mirror 11 is arranged and positioned so that its reflective surface is on the concave part of its contour . actually , the point a is a reflection of a point b , which is the center of a scene formed on a toroidal rear - projection screen 12 . the spherical mirror 11 collimates the scene on the screen 12 . as the following description unfolds , it will become obvious how the invention in its present embodiment is able to provide to a trainee in a simulator an image of an area of interest which image is substantially undistorted and undiminished in its illumination , i . e ., with maximum brightness . first , a decision is made as to the area to be displayed during training , and a flight is made in an actual aircraft over that area with a motion picture camera attached to the aircraft pointed at the area of interest . the processed film then is used as an image source for the invention . the trainee sits in a simulated aircraft cockpit , which is an exact duplicate of that of the real aircraft , and in this position , he must &# 34 ; fly &# 34 ; in a simulated path , which approximates the actual path followed by the aircraft from which the motion picture was taken . arranged around the windows of his simulated cockpit is the visual display , which is projected realistically by television monitors . the remainder of the system to be described herein , which may be at a remote location to the cockpit position , operates upon the film image to give it the proper perspective from the trainee &# 39 ; s viewpoint in the simulator and to position it properly in his field of view . this is done by viewing the image as it is projected by a television camera using well known optical and electronic techniques . a visual display arrangement in accordance with the present invention permits an adjustment to the display which has not been attainable heretofore . referring back again to fig1 of the drawings , the numeral 12 identifies a rear -

"the following description represents the inventors &# 39 ; current preferred embodiment . the description is not meant to limit the invention , but rather to illustrate its general principles of operation . examples are illustrated with the accompanying drawings . fig7 shows a high level flow chart for the software method associated with the system . some operations are only performed on set - up of operation : 99 initial start , 26 loading map database ; 62 create bgrs through sub - routine , and 56 system initialization . the map database 26 can be purchased from any map database vendor , or a crowd - sourced map database can be used . the system initialization includes such administrative routines as forming the nplut , populating the nplut with any available data , creating a user database , populating the user database with any available data , and similar tasks . once the system has been initialized 56 and the bgrs have been created with the bgr sub 62 , the system is capable of taking navigation input 55 . fig1 shows the earth 301 inscribed in a tessellated cube 302 . on a computer , the virtual earth 301 can be rotated or tilted until a geographic land mass of interest is centered . under almost all circumstances , even though the earth 301 is an oblate spheroid , the geographic region of interest can be made to be almost parallel with a face of the inscribing cube 302 . by properly selecting the size of the tessellation on the cube 302 , one can influence the size of the bgr projected onto the earth 301 . this method is called virtual tessellation , because the pattern on the earth 301 is not technically a tessellation , because all of the bgrs will not be the same shape and size . fig8 shows a method of generating bgrs using virtual tessellation . first , the system inscribes the earth in a cube 44 . the center of the cube face 45 is centered over the geographic region of interest . a starting tessellation size 46 for the face of the cube is selected . the standard surface area (“ ssa ”) is the target surface area for the bgrs . a bgr ssa of approximately 1 sq . km seems ideal . next , the variation limit for the ssa 64 is set . this number should be small ( less than 10 %). all bgrs should have a surface area very close to the ssa in order to minimize the potential for confounded data ( non - orthogonal independent variables during an analysis of variance ). if desired , the size of the tessellation squares 47 on the inscribing cube can be varied . although this is computationally more difficult , it will minimize ssa variation ( only the inner most piece is a square , with each proceeding layer being rectangles with higher and higher aspect ratios . the cube tessellation is projected onto the earth 48 to create initial bgrs . the ssa of all bgrs is assessed 49 . if the ssa analysis is okay 50 , the bgrs are stored 53 , and the bgr generation process ends 59 . if the ssa analysis is not okay 50 , all the bgrs are erased 51 . next , the system adjusts the starting tessellation size 52 , the outer layer tessellation ratio ( how quickly the outer layers of the tessellated cube face become rectangles of higher and higher aspect ratio ) is adjusted 63 , and adjust the ssa variation limit 64 . the whole process is then started again 47 . fig9 shows the flow chart for an alternative embodiment for generating bgrs . the process is started 58 by finding the centroid of the geographic region of interest 65 . a single bgr is created 66 with a surface area equal to the ssa and at least four sides . the ssa variation limit is set 64 . a layer of bgrs is created around the existing bgr ( s ), in which the new layer of bgrs has its perimeter minimized 67 . the ssa for the layer is analyzed 49 . as long as the ssa analysis is okay , additional layers of bgrs are added . if the ssa is not okay 50 , the ssa for just the last layer is analyzed 69 . if the last layer includes bgrs which overlap the border of the geographic region of interest 70 , and that is the sole cause of the unacceptable ssa , the bgrs are stored 71 . if it ","fig1 is a schematic illustration of a computer system 100 adapted to implement techniques to manage access to computer components . in the illustrated embodiment , computer system 100 may be embodied as a hand -

"first of all , we will consider the reason why conventional distortion correction systems can not judge and correct scanning error ( overlapping scan 1 and underlapping scan 2 shown in fig1 ) distortion with reference to fig1 and 2 . fig2 shows the outline of the landsat 4 satellite tm sensor . an oscillating scanning mirror 8 reciprocatingly scans the ground surface in the direction corresponding to that indicated by an arrow 9 to take photographs of the ground surface . the image obtained by photographing the ground surface exhibits differences between forward scanning 6 and backward scanning 7 due to the attitude fluctuation of the scanning mirror and satellite as represented by the corrected image coordinate system 4 in fig1 . the following processes ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) are carried out in order to correct the received image . ( 1 ) the mapping function φ representing geometric correspondence from the received uncorrected image coordinate system 3 to the corrected image coordinate system 4 is determined . the mapping function φ is determined from data such as the orbit attitude data of the satellite , the scanning angle , and the like . ( 2 ) a representative point on the corrected image coordinate system 4 such as a point ( x i , y i ) on the received image corresponding to the normal grid point ( u i , v i ), for example , is obtained by repeated calculation of convergence of the mapping function φ ( primarily because the inverse mapping function φ - 1 can not be determined ), and the points corresponding to those other than the representative point are interpolated to approximate the inverse mapping function φ - 1 . ( 3 ) the point of the corrected pixel position ( u , v ) is obtained from the corresponding point ( x , y ) with the approximate inverse mapping function φ - 1 , and the surrounding received image data is interpolated to obtain a corrected image intensity value , since its position does not generally correspond to the pixel position on the received image . if the mapping function φ is continuous , the distortion correction processing described above can approximate the inverse mapping function φ - 1 with an arbitrary level of accuracy by increasing the density of the representative point on the output image ; hence , it does not present any problem . when the received image coordinate system 3 has an overlapping scan 1 or an underlapping scan 2 , however , the mapping function φ is a many - to - one or a zero - to - one relation and approximation with the continuous function is impossible . hereinafter , one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the reciprocating two - plane distortion model of the landsat 4 satellite by referring to fig3 and 4 . the mapping function φ representing the correspondence between the corrected image coordinate system 4 and the uncorrected image coordinate system 3 is the function that uses the attitude angle θ ( t ) of the satellite , the position γ ( t ) and the scanning angle β ( t ) as its variables . mapping φ ( x , y ) from the uncorrected image coordinates x - y to the corrected image coordinates u - v can be expressed by the following formula . here , t represents the time , and is a function of the uncorrected image coordinates x - y as t = t ( x , y ): the present invention is practiced with the following [ a ] and [ b ]. [ a ]: introduction of double mapping functions φ 1 - 1 and φ 2 - 1 mapping φ - 1 from the corrected image coordinate system u - v to the uncorrected image coordinate system x - y is not 1 : 1 mapping on the tm image for the following reasons ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). ( 1 ) there is a region ω 1 , scanning overlap region , on the corrected image where mapping is a one - to - many relation . ( 2 ) there is a region ω 2 , the scanning underlap region , on the corrected image where no corresponding point exists on the uncorrected image coordinate system x - y . therefore , the present invention considers the two coordinates systems x 1 - y 1 and x 2 - y 2 to be the uncorrected image coordinate system 3 . these two coordinates","fig9 illustrates exemplary steps for utilizing a posteriori measurements to adjust a projection imaging tool . each step is discussed in detail below . first , a process of reference ( por ) for manufacturing a chip is provided . in abbreviated and truncated form , fig6 is one example . of greatest relevance to the present invention are the specific machine settings utilized . table 2 shows an example of the relevant information extracted from the por . knowledge of machine setting indentifiers is required for running the in - situ metrology tests . in table 2 , the photographic layer is the name of the lithographic layer in process . the machine model is the machine model ( not specific identity ) used . the xpotype ( exposure type ) is the static / dynamic for stepper / scanner models . the laid ( lens aberration identifier ) is the keyword typed into or selected on the machine in the recipe or at exposure time that sets the lens manipulators or adjusters to a specific state . the sid ( source identifier ) similar to laid but specifies the source configuration utilized . the xid ( exit pupil identifier ) similar to laid but specifies the exit pupil numerical aperture utilized . the trid ( track identifier ) similar to laid but specifies the photoresist coat / develop recipe utilized . the field size / layout is the description of the exposure field size and pitch on wafer ; the last entry describes layout ; can also contain scanner direction and scan speed . the f nom is the nominal machine focus in nanometers . the e is the nominal exposure dose in mj / cm 2 . for each lithographic layer of the process deemed as critical ( low c pk ) we run some or all of the in - situ metrology tests outlined and referenced in table 3 . as an example , table 2 defines the lens manipulator settings ( laid ) required for the gate definition layer of process 80065 . machine model ( not serial number or specific machine id ( maid )) s2071 is qualified for that layer and the user would set or type in “ abb1 ” on the machine console at exposure time or have it specified within the job deck for this process and layer on all machines of model s2071 . to measure the lens aberrations , we would run each machine of model s2071 at laid =“ abb1 ” but with sid , xid , trjd and field size / layout as described in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 978 , 085 , supra ; the exposure portions of the process being detailed in fig1 a of that reference . measuring the box - in - box patterns , we could then reconstruct the higher order ( focus and above ) lens aberrations . the resulting zernike coefficients provide the basis for the next step . at this point we assess the current state of adjustment of our machines and correct them . the preferred method for assessing the current state of machine adjustment is a direct machine emulation that utilizes a database containing the history and current machine state ( see , a . smith et al ., “ method of emulation of lithographic projection tools ”, u . s . patent application ser . no . 11 / 111 , 302 , filed apr . 20 , 2005 ). since we are concerned with corrections to slowly varying (& gt ; 1 day ) machine characteristics in the emulator , we turn off rapid (& lt ; 1 day ) machine variations and look at individual or machine - to - machine process capability . based on these results , we then determine which machines require adjustment and by what amount . continuing the gate layer / lens aberration example above , using the nominal focus and exposure dose , we calculate the gate linewidth as a function of focus and exposure at a collection of field points representative of the exposure field size . including random focus errors at each field point gives us the focus process variation . from this information we can determine whether the machine requires adjustment and by what amount . having decided how much we need to adjust each machine , there are a number of ways to implement the adjustment , some being : 1 ) adjust all machines at once , 2 ) gradually adjust machines into compliance , and 3 ) a combination of 1 ) an"

s core logic circuitry 214 . specifically ( according to one embodiment ), over the expanse of a single display refresh cycle , except for a relatively brief period of time in which an entire display refresh cycle &# 39 ; s worth of data is read from system memory 201 and entered into the display fifo 213 , the memory controller &# 39 ; s core logic circuitry 208 is deactivated through the disabling of the mcc clock 212 and the system memory 202 is placed in “ self refresh ” mode . the graphics controller ( s ) 216 may also be deactivated . during the relatively brief period of time in which an entire refresh cycle &# 39 ; s worth of data is entered into the display fifo 213 , the mcc clock 212 is enabled and the system memory is placed in “ auto refresh ” mode . an embodiment of the scheme can be better understood in reference to fig2 and fig3 together . referring to fig2 and 3 , at time t 0 , the display fifo 213 is “ full ” or otherwise contains enough data to refresh an entire screen &# 39 ; s worth of visual content . starting in this state , note that the mcc clock 212 , 312 is “ off ”, the mic clock 209 , 309 is “ off ”, the memory clock 211 , 311 is “ off ”, and the memory &# 39 ; s data bus 210 , 310 is quiet ( i . e ., substantive data is not being read from system memory 202 ). because the mcc clock 212 , 312 is “ off ” the memory controller &# 39 ; s core logic 208 and graphics controller ( s ) 216 are not consuming large amounts of electrical power . because the mic clock 209 , 309 is also “ off ” and because the memory clock 211 , 311 is derived from the mic clock 209 , 309 , a memory clock 211 , 311 is not being supplied to the system memory 202 by the memory controller 201 . because the memory clock 211 , 311 is “ off ”, the system memory 202 is in “ self - refresh ” mode ( i . e ., the system memory 202 does not use an external clock in preventing its internal data from being lost ). therefore as of time t 0 , the display fifo 213 is “ full ” ( or otherwise contains enough data to refresh an entire screen &# 39 ; s worth of visual content ), the memory controller &# 39 ; s core logic 208 and graphics controller ( s ) 216 are in a reduced power consumption state , and , the system memory 202 is in “ self refresh ” mode . this essentially corresponds to a situation where both the memory controller 201 and the system memory 202 are in reduced power consumption states . from time t 0 to t 1 data is read from the display fifo 213 for the purposes of refreshing the content rendered on the display 205 . during this time period , the memory controller 201 and system memory 202 are in their reduced power consumption states as described above . at time t 1 , however , fifo state detection logic circuitry 216 detects that the display fifo 213 state has fallen to a first “ watermark level ” wm 1 . the wm 1 level essentially indicates that the display fifo 213 is becoming sufficiently empty and will soon need more data if it is to continue supporting the rendering of new content on the display 205 . as such , notice of the wm 1 level being reached is directed from the fifo state detection logic circuitry 216 to clock control logic circuitry 217 on the memory controller 201 . in response , the clock control logic circuitry 217 “ wakes up ” the mcc clock 212 , 312 such that it emits its one or more clock signals . in the particular implementation being discussed herein , the mcc clock 212 , 312 and the logi"
"the invention relates to anamorphic objective lenses , and in particular to a range of different focal length anamorphic objective lenses covering at least a focal length range from 25 mm to 135 mm and providing low residual chromatic aberration , a traditional oval bokeh shape and different depths of field in the vertical and horizontal azimuth directions of the field . the term “ lens group ” as used in connection with the anamorphic objective lens disclosed herein means one or more individual lens elements . also , the terms “ optical stop ” and “ stop ” are equivalent terms that can be used interchangeably . a “ field stop ” as the term is used herein is a stop where the chief rays do not go through the center of the stop at the optical axis and the general purpose of a field stop is to vignette the edges of the radiation beams . in the example provided herein , the front lens group is negatively powered and the rear lens group is positively powered and they have been paired with an anamorphic lens group to work in unison and match the preferred optical interface characteristics of sensors , where near telecentric radiation beams approach the sensor . the example embodiment discussed below is a medium fast full aperture moderately wide angle field of view anamorphic objective lens of the fixed focal length ( prime ) type . in the example embodiment , all of the lens elements are made from glasses . the lens element optical surface shapes in the spherical first lens group and the spherical third lens groups are all rotationally symmetrical about the optical axis such as spherical and in the anamorphic second lens group at least one lens element surface shape is non - rotationally symmetrical about the optical axis such as cylindrical . the aforementioned optical example , although providing these kinds of features and others like low breathing and telecentric radiation output at the sensor , are capable of achieving suitable levels of various performance including image quality resolution and contrast , high relative illumination for low shading and efficient optical throughput at the sensor via near telecentric radiation output at the sensor , which telecentric radiation output is less than about 10 degrees . the novel configuration of having a negatively powered spherical first lens group , an anamorphic second lens group followed by a positively powered spherical third lens group containing an optical stop may produce some residual distortion , astigmatism and field curvature aberrations but those aberrations to a tolerable extent contribute to the anamorphic look as desired by many cinematographers . in addition , a balanced blend of the afore - described lens characteristics may aid in cost reduction of manufacture . with the advent and adoption of digital cameras employing electronic sensors a large back focal length which was once required for film cameras having a reflex mirror may be less necessary but is still provided for in the novel anamorphic objective lens . the example embodiment disclosed operates at an aperture of f / 2 . 4 and over a waveband of 455 - 656 nm and this waveband is what was used in the transverse ray aberration ( tra ) figures ( see bottom right of tra figures ) and in the mtf figures ( see top right of mtf figures ). a faster or slower aperture may be required and an extended waveband may be required . the aperture may be increased or reduced and the waveband expanded and the optical designs re - optimized to maximize image quality over such apertures and wavebands without departing from the invention . also , during such re - optimization alternate glass types may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure . furthermore , more complex optical surface shapes such as aspherical and free - form surfaces may be introduced for expanded performance but at the likely effect of increased manufacturing cost . fig1 - 16 relate to an example embodiment in which the focal length in the y and x directions are 42 . 47 mm and 21 . 47 mm , the overall length is 245 mm from","referring to the block diagram of the system of fig3 accordingly to one embodiment of the present invention the host 11 provides an address ain to a multiplexer 13 . the multiplexer 13 output a 1 is applied to a counter 15 that increments the address . the output of the counter 15 is the other input to the multiplexer 13 such that the address output a 1 from the multiplexer is provided either from the counter 15 or address ain directly from the host 11 . the control input advz ( address valid ) and baaz ( burst address advance ) from the host is applied to logic 17 that controls the multiplexer 13 . the address a 1 from the multiplexer 13 is applied to a current address latch 19 for the flash memory bank 21 . the row address bits output of the current address latch 19 are applied to a comparator 23 . the previous row address bits from the previous address is stored in previous address latch 25 . the output from the previous row address latch 25 is also applied to comparator 23 . the row address bits of the current address is compared to the row address bits of the previous address in the comparator 23 to determine if there is a match . a multiplexer gate 27 is controlled by the output of the comparator 23 . the input to the multiplexer 27 is a signal indicating the need for either the normal or page number of wait states . if there is a match at comparator 23 a logic ‘ 1 ’ corresponding to page wait state count signal condition is provided to wait state generator 29 to provide the appropriate wait time for the special bust access for the ready and pready signal generation . if there is not a match a logic ‘ 0 ’ is provided to the generator 29 and appropriate wait time is provided for the full normal address for the ready and pready signals . this circuit provides the logic to determine if there is a row match or not , and hence , to produce ready and pready signals at the appropriate time . in special burst access read the read port interface synchronously generates addresses while baaz , burst address advance , is active low , unless advz is also active low during a rising edge of the system clock . if advz is also low then the address present on the input address bus supersedes the address which would have been generated by the read port interface . the automatic address generation can only occur after an initial address has been latched into the read port interface read port interface . this is accomplished with the first advz pulse , regardless of the state of baaz . special burst access mode has an advantage over standard read in that if the sequential or input address is on the same physical row in the flash bank as the previous access then the wait states are based on the page mode , wtpage , number of wait states . which may be less than the wait states for a standard read . if the next access is from the subsequent row then the wait states are based on the standard read , wtread , number of wait states . dividing the number of bits per wordline by the width of a word determines the number of words which may be read in a page with the page number of wait states . the first access to the bank may be either a standard read access or a special burst read access . in fact , baaz can be active 100 % of the time . if a burst access , the read port interface determines whether it is the first or a subsequent access , to correctly set the number of wait states . if baaz is modulated during read operation then any transitions it makes must occur before the rising edge of clock which follows the rising edge in which the address is latched in . this is regardless of the number of wait states in either standard or page read modes . otherwise , baaz may be kept high or low at all times . fig4 is an example of special burst read and shows a burst access crossing a wordline boundary . this example has one wait state in random access mode and no wait states in burst mode . another example of special burst access read timing is shown in fig5 . in this mode the addresses while burst mode is active , baaz is low , are generated , b"
"in describing the instant invention , reference is made to the drawings , wherein there is seen in fig1 a copier 10 having a rectangular reciprocating carriage 12 that is movably mounted on top of a cabinet 11 . the carriage 12 includes a transparent platen 14 on which documents ( not shown ) are placed face down for copying . overlying the platen 14 is an opaque , movable cover 16 which has a white surface juxtaposed to the platen 14 . the cover 16 is connected to one side of the carriage 12 . in the preferred embodiment , the cover 16 is made of a relatively flexible material that is connected by a hinge to one of the longer sides of the carriage 12 . the cover 16 has a handle 17 disposed opposite to the hinged side of the cover 16 . an operator can manipulate the handle 17 in order to raise and lower the cover 16 and so that documents can be placed on and removed from the platen 14 . the carriage 12 is shown in fig1 in its extreme right or home position . during a copy cycle , the carriage moves to the left a predetermined distance that is long enough to enable the copier 10 to make copies of fourteen inch long documents . underneath the carriage 12 is an illuminating station , generally indicated at 20 , which includes a relatively narrow , transparent window 27 that is mounted on the upper surface 19 of the cabinet 11 . the window 27 extends across the width of the upper surface 19 . a light source is operatively disposed underneath window 27 , and comprises a linear lamp 28 axially aligned and partially surrounded by a hyperbolic - shaped reflector 30 which serves to direct the light from the lamp 28 toward the window 27 . as the carriage 12 moves from right to left , a document on the carriage 12 passes over the illumination window 27 and is illuminated by the light from lamp 28 . in other words , the document is scan exposed across the illuminating station 20 , which will be discussed in further detail hereinbelow . an image of the document is transmitted to the photoreceptor belt 40 at an imaging station generally designated 35 . the image is transmitted along a z - shaped path by an optical system comprising tilted mirrors 22 and 26 and a lens 24 . the mirror 22 forms an image of the illuminated document as the latter passes over the window 27 , and reflects the light toward the converging lens 24 , which is directed upon the second tilted mirror 26 which in turn reflects the coverging rays onto a portion of the photoreceptor belt 40 at the imaging station 35 . the photoreceptor belt 40 is moved through the imaging station at a predetermined speed by a drive roller 42 in synchronism with the movement of the carriage 12 across the illuminating station 20 . the motive power for turning the drive roller 42 is supplied by a main motor 62 through a suitable drive system that includes a drive chain 61 ( partially shown ), which also drives other elements including the magnetic brush 37 , the carriage 12 , and the feed and queuing rollers 46 and 48 respectively . the fixing rollers 54 are driven by a second motor 63 . the photoreceptor belt 40 is supported underneath the z - shaped optical system 21 by the relatively large diameter drive roller 42 and also a relatively small diameter idler roller 44 . the rollers 42 and 44 are diagonally displaced from each other and by virtue of the relative difference in their size , the photoreceptor belt 40 takes on a shape similar to a teardrop . the belt 40 itself comprises an upper photosensitive layer , preferably of zinc oxide ( zno ) that is coated on a conductive substrate , preferably one made of metalized polyester film , such as mylar brand film with an aluminum base . disposed around the periphery of the photoreceptor belt 40 are a number of the operating components of the copier 10 . in particular , a two - wire corona charging unit 32 is juxtaposed to the photoreceptor belt 40 at approximately a one o &# 39 ; clock position with respect to the drive roller 42 . the charging unit 32 is operable to impart a uniform electrostatic charge to the zinc oxide surface of the p","one embodiment of the present invention to be described is illustrated in fig3 which is a block diagram . the same components of fig3 as those of fig1 are denoted by the same reference numerals as in fig1 . referring to fig3 ac bridge circuits are again indicated by numerals 1 , 2 and 3 , and the output signals v 1 , v 2 and v 3 from the circuits 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively , are coupled to a switching circuit 20 , which acts to deliver the output signals v 1 , v 2 and v 3 in succession in response to time - sharing signals q 1 - q 3 ( described later ). the circuit 20 consists of tc 4066bp quad bilateral switch manufactured by tokyo shibaura electric co ., ltd ., japan , for example . a differential amplifier 30 receives bridge output signals v 1 - v 3 from the switching circuit 20 at one input , and a reference signal from the terminal c of the bridge circuit 1 at the other input . a comparator 40 has a comparison input to which the output signal v 4 from the amplifer 30 is applied and a reference input to which voltages divided down to certain values by resistor r 1 and resistor r 2 , r 3 or r 4 are applied when time - sharing signals q 1 , q 2 and q 3 , respectively , are supplied to the input . a central processing unit cpu controls the coin sorting operation and a vending machine ( not shown ) and other operations in accordance with a program previously stored in a rom ( not shown ). the cpu delivers the time - sharing signals q 1 - q 3 to the switching circuit 20 and supplies the time - sharing signals q 1 - q 3 to the resistors r 1 - r 4 for producing reference voltages to be fed to the comparator 40 . in response to the time - sharing signals q 1 - q 3 , the circuit 20 supplies the output signals v 1 - v 3 from the bridge circuits 1 - 3 to the comparison input of the comparator 40 in succession via the amplifier 30 . at the same time , the voltages derived by the voltage - dividing action of either resistors r 1 and r 2 , resistors r 1 and r 3 , or resistors r 1 and r 4 are successively fed to the reference input of the comparator 40 in response to the time - sharing signals q 1 - e , ovs / q / 3 . this permits the bridge output signals v 1 - v 3 to be compared with different reference voltages . the output from the comparator 40 is supplied to the cpu as a sorting signal sg . the successive changes in the reference voltage of the comparator 40 by the use of the signals q 1 - q 3 are made to alter the permissible range for every denomination of coin to be accepted . for example , the range is made narrower for a coin of larger denomination , while the range is made broader for a coin of a smaller denomination . however , if the size of the permissible range is held constant for all kinds of coins to be accepted , then it is not necessary to change the reference voltage of the comparator 40 in response to the time - sharing signals q 1 - q 3 . in this way , the present invention is characterized by the successive changes in the bridge output signals v 1 - v 3 or the reference voltage of the comparator 40 using the time - sharing signals delivered by the cpu . the manner in which the time - sharing signals are delivered is next described with reference to the flow chart of fig4 illustrating a program for causing the cpu to deliver time - sharing signals . this program is controlled by coin sensors ( not shown ) which are respectively disposed in front and back of the detecting coil sc arranged along a coin passageway to sense passage of coins ( not shown ). such a coin sensor is well known as disclosed in japanese patent laid - open no . 2196 / 1979 already proposed by the present applicant . referring to fig4 after the power is turned on in step 101 , it is determined whether a coin is inserted , that is , whether a coin sensor positioned near a coin slot has sensed a coin . if a coin is sensed , the program proceeds to step 102 , in which the time - sharing signals q 1 and q 1 are delivered and a first timer for setting the durations of these signals is started . this operation of the timer will be described late"

to - point link that connects to fc - pci bus adapter 25 to provide fast point - to - point communication between the hosts . in an alternative embodiment , the interconnect network 30 such as a fc fabric provides extra bandwidth for host - to - host communications . in this embodiment , links 28 , 38 connect to the interconnect network 30 and the hosts use link 28 and link 38 when available . fc standard software can set priority levels to ensure high priority peer - to - peer requests , but there will still be some arbitration overhead and latency in claiming ownership of the links . for example , if links 28 and 38 are busy transferring data when a write request arrives , that operation must complete before either link is free for arbitration . if the interconnect 40 ever fails , communication between hosts can be handled using the interconnect network 30 . the interconnect network 30 can be implemented by","with reference now to the figures , and in particular with reference to fig1 there is depicted a high -

"turning to fig1 - 4 , examples of screen displays that may be presented in certain embodiments of the present invention are illustrated . fig1 shows a market cell 100 that may be used to display one or more bid and / or one or more offer 101 for an item to be traded . as illustrated , bid and offer 101 indicates a price 102 which a buyer is willing to pay for a selected item 103 at a given size 106 ( i . e ., a number of the item ) and a price 104 which a seller is willing to accept for selected item 103 at a given size 108 . each component of a market shown in market cell 100 may be marked with a color , or in any other suitable manner , to indicate features of that component . for example , as shown in fig1 , the entire area of fields 102 , 103 , 104 , 106 , and 108 may be colored , or only the symbols in those fields may be colored , to assign a meaning to each field . as a further example , a specific color may be assigned to field 102 to indicate that a price in the field is a bid price . preferably , a trader is able to specify the color assigned to each component of a trade . the fields , or symbols contained therein , may be continuously colored or may be shown in a chosen color when a mouse pointer is passed over each field or used to click on each field . in order to bid for , offer to sell , buy , and / or sell an item through market cell 100 , a trader may submit a trading command indicating the action to be taken using various approaches . for example , in preferred embodiments , a trader may submit the trading command using a command - line interface , by clicking on components of bid and offer 101 , and / or using a graphical interface . when using a command - line interface , a trading command may be entered in any non - graphical interface desired . for example , a trader may submit a trading command by pressing buttons on a keyboard . likewise , a trader could use a voice recognition system to enter commands verbally , or a trader could use some combination of voice recognition , keyboard , and pointing device . a trader may also indicate a desire to bid , offer , buy , and / or sell an item by clicking on different portions of a bid and offer 101 for that item in market cell 100 . for example , if the trader clicks on bid price 102 , the trader may indicate to submit a bid for the item . if the trader clicks on offer price 104 , the trader may indicate to submit an offer for the item . if the trader clicks on bid size 106 , the trader may submit a command to sell the item . and , if the trader clicks on offer size 108 , the trader may submit a command to buy the item . preferred embodiments of the present invention may allow a trader to use different levels of mouse button entries to initiate a trading command . that is , for flexibility , this invention may allow a trader to determine how many clicks on components of bid or offer 101 using a button of a mouse are required before the trader either bids for , offers to sell , buys , and / or sells an item corresponding to the market cell . for example , for maximum speed and slightly more risk , the trader may choose that a market be acted upon after a single click on a component of bid or offer 101 . likewise , a trader may choose to use a double click on a market before it is acted upon . fig2 illustrates one embodiment of a graphical interface for submitting trading commands . as shown , the graphical interface comprises a dialog window 200 with various buttons and entry fields 202 - 242 . using these buttons and entry fields , a trader may submit a bid command , an offer command , a buy command , or a sell command for an item corresponding to a market cell 100 . preferably , each traded item uses a unique dialog window 200 . dialog window 200 may be opened automatically and / or manually before , during , and / or after a trade , and may allow a trader to submit a trade command at any time . the dialog window may be repositioned on a trader &# 39 ; s display and / or fixed in place . the trader , preferably , will keep the window associated with a p","referring to fig1 the programmable character display module 10 of the invention includes : a flexible substrate 12 ; a plurality of electrical conductors 14 and 16 , which can be oriented along an x - axis of the substrate ; a plurality of electrical conductors 18 and 20 , which can be oriented along a y - axis of the substrate ; a plurality of spaced apart character displays 22 , 24 , 26 , and 28 , which can be formed by separate light emitting diodes ( leds ) arranged in a 5 × 7 row - and - column character array as illustrated , that are electrically connected to selected ones of the x - axis electrical conductors and of the y - axis electrical conductors ; and , inflexible transparent material 32 , 34 , 36 , and 38 , which can be a conventional epoxy flowed into position and suitably cured to its inflexible state , that encapsulates both the character displays and respective adjoining portions 42 , 44 , 46 , and 48 of the substrate , which thereby converts the adjoining portions from the flexible state to the inflexible state so that any damage to the character displays by an applied force is substantially minimized or eliminated . a portion of the programmable character display module 10 is shown by fig2 and 3 as an enlarged view for purposes of clarity of description and a better understanding of the invention . the flexible substrate 12 has a base substrate sheet 50 and an overlay sheet 52 on the base sheet . the overlay sheet 52 is preferably bonded to the base sheet 50 which develops a flexible bonded joint 54 as more clearly shown by fig5 . the base sheet 50 can be a relatively thin , stable , dielectric and flexible sheet cut to a desired shape with the electrical conductors , such as conductors 14 and 18 , positioned on the base sheet in a desired geometric layout ; for example , the x - and y - axes layout as shown . the electrical conductors can be applied to the base sheet by any one of several conventional processes such as photo etch . in the programmable character display module 10 as shown by fig2 the electrical conductors 14 and 18 terminate at a plurality of similar connector pads 56 and 58 , respectively . the overlay sheet 52 , which can have the same physical properties as the base sheet 50 , has a plurality of display apertures like display aperture 60 as shown by fig2 and 3 selectively positioned in the overlay sheet to register with the connector pads , such as connector pads 56 and 58 . the flexible substrate 12 is completed by bonding the overlay sheet 52 to the base sheet 50 as described hereinbefore . with the exception of the display apertures , such as aperture or window 60 , the resulting bonded joint 54 ( see fig5 ) seals the flexible substrate either hermetically or otherwise as may be required for the end use of the display module 10 . referring to fig2 , and 5 , the perimeter edge 62 of the display aperture 60 is not bonded to the base sheet 50 and is formed with an irregular contour . for example , the perimeter edge 62 is jagged and , as illustrated , can be serrated . the perimeter edge 62 of each display aperture , such as display aperture 60 , in the overlay sheet 52 is bent away and spaced from the base sheet 50 to develop an angular relationship therebetween which is more clearly shown at 64 of fig5 . the desirable results obtained from the serrated perimeter edge 62 and its bent or angular relationship 64 are described hereinafter . as shown by fig3 when the character display 22 is positioned within the display aperture 60 of the overlay sheet 52 and electrically connected to the selected connector pads 56 and 58 ( see fig2 ), the perimeter edge 62 encloses the character display interjacent the display and the adjoining portion 42 of the substrate 12 . since the lighted character display 22 is relatively fragile , particularly when the display is an array of leds as shown by fig3 the flexible substrate 12 is converted to an inflexible state at the display aperture 60 and its adjoining portion 42 by flowing the transparent material 32 over the array . the transparent material "
"referring first to fig2 wherein like numerals designate the same element throughout the several drawings , there are three fibers with at least one fiber being an optical fiber 10 braided together into an interwoven strand or braid 16 . in the preferred embodiment , the spatial bend frequency of the braid 16 corresponds to the optimum microbend frequency for the optical fiber 10 . the spatial bend frequency is thus set to obtain the greatest amount of microbending loss in the optical fiber . this maximizes the sensitivity to changes in length . alternatively , under some circumstances , it may be beneficial to decrease the sensitivity to changes in length ( e . g ., to increase the range of measurement ) through using a spatial bend frequency for the braid which is either greater or less than the optimum spatial bend frequency for the optical fiber used . the braid or strand 16 is then attached to a workpiece or structure to be measured at attachment points 18 and tensioned with a tension adjustment 20 . alternatively , the braid or strand 16 may be held in the desired level of tension by a tensioning means prior to and during its attachment to the workpiece or structure ; the tensioning means may then be removed following the attachment thus eliminating the tensioning means as a potential source of error and permitting a single tensioning means 20 to be used to install multiple braids . the braid 10 is thus preloaded in tension when installed on the workpiece or structure . this establishes the zero or reference length of the braid 10 and permits the measurement of both increases and decreases in the length of the workpiece or structure . alternatively , if the direction of the change in length to be measured is known in advance , the initial tension may be adjusted to produce the maximum range or sensitivity for the measurement . an optical signal applying means 22 is a source to provide light into each of the active optical fibers as is illustrated by the arrow in entering optical fiber 10 in fig2 . the light exiting the optical fiber 10 is directed to a photo - detector 28 which measures the intensity of the optical signal transmitted through the optical fiber 10 . conveniently , the optical signal applying means 22 includes a light source 24 and a light splitting means 26 connected to one end of each optical fiber 10 for simultaneously applying the optical signal . suitable light sources include a light emitting diode ( led ), laser , or laser diode . the detection means may include any means of detecting changes in the intensity of the optical signal at the wavelength of the optical signal applying means , such as a photodiode . an example of the light splitting means 26 includes a 3 db coupler with the aid of known optical splices . a beneficial arrangement of the splitting means includes a provision for a portion of the signal from the optical applying means to pass directly to a reference photodetector without passing through the optical fiber 10 . the signal from the photodetector 28 may then be ratioed to the signal from the reference photodetector to provide an output signal which is independent of any source intensity variations . the degree of sensitivity to microbend loss depends on the wavelength of the light employed and the fiber characteristics ; these establish the optimum spatial bend frequency for maximum attenuation as a result of microbending . the sensitivity of the braid or strand 16 can be altered by changing these parameters , or through changing the physical parameters of the braid . for a given spatial bend frequency , the longer the braid is , the greater the sensitivity is because of the larger number of spatial bends . conversely , a shorter braid has less sensitivity because the number of spatial bends is less . similarly , increasing the number of active optical fibers in the braid increases the number of spatial bends ; i . e ., for a given length and spatial bend frequency , a braid with two active optical fibers has twice the sensitivity of a braid with a single active optical fiber ","turning now to the details of the drawings , fig1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a preferred embodiment of an imaging system 1 in accordance with the present invention . system 1 broadly comprises an illumination subsystem 10 , an imaging subsystem 12 provided in an housing 14 , and a control subsystem 16 . the imaging subsystem 12 comprises a ccd camera subsystem 18 housed within a camera chamber 20 of housing 14 and a lens subassembly 22 extending between camera chamber 20 and a specimen chamber 24 . in operation , illumination subsystem 10 provides the necessary light energy to be applied to the specimen within chamber 24 . light energy emitted by the specimen is transmitted through lens subsystem 22 to camera 18 , where an image is formed and transmitted to the control subsystem 16 for processing . control subsystem 16 comprises a camera control unit 26 , which is a conventional unit matched to the particular camera 18 and a computer 28 which is programmed to control unit 26 and to receive data from camera 18 , in order to achieve unique control and processing in accordance with the present invention . the light source for the illumination subsystem 10 is preferably an arc lamp 30 . light from lamp 30 is conducted via a liquid light guide 32 to the optical coupler or filter wheel 34 . the liquid light guide 32 is advantageous in that it transmits in the uv range , and in that it acts to diffuse the input illumination more than a fiber optic would do . the optical coupler 34 contains a conventional filter holder ( not shown ) for standard , one inch diameter interference filters . in the preferred configuration , a computer controlled filter wheel is used instead of the optical coupler . the filter wheel can contain a number of filters , which can be rapidly changed under computer direction . a fiber optic bundle 36 carries illumination from the optic coupler or filter wheel 34 to within the light - tight specimen chamber 24 . the bundle 36 passes through a baffle 38 , which allows it to move up and down during focusing of the specimen holder . alternatively , the fiber optic bundle 40 from the epi - illumination ring light in lens 22 may be connected to the optical coupler 34 . three forms of illumination system are described , each fed by a discrete fiber bundle . these are a transilluminating plate ( 42 ), a ring light external to the lens ( not shown ), and a ring light 44 internal to the lens ( 22 ) that performs epi - illumination . the transillumination plate is a rectangular chamber 50 ( see fig6 and 7 ), within which the discrete fibers 52 from bundle 51 are separated and rotated by 90 degrees so that they point laterally , towards the specimen . the fibers 52 are distributed within the chamber in such a way that they minimize shading within the illumination pattern . to this end , a larger number of fibers lie in the peripherally outward portions of the chamber than lie at its center . the rectangular chamber 50 contains a diffusing screen 54 , and a quartz glass diffusing plate 56 . these diffusing elements take as their input the discrete points of light from the fibers 52 , and create a homogenous illumination over the surface of the plate 56 . the chamber 50 may also contain a dark field stop , to allow light to enter the specimen from the side . the external ring light consists of a ring of optical fibers aligned with the axis of the lens , with a hole in the center large enough to encircle the lens 22 . the working distance of the ring light is matched to the focus distance of the lens 22 . the internal ring light 44 consists of a ring of optical fibers , mounted within and axially aligned with the body of the telecentric lens 22 , and behind its front lens element . a diffuser , polarizer , or other circular element may be placed at the front of the fiber ring 44 . the specimen well plate is carried within a holder 58 ( fig6 ) that is mounted to the fiber optic chamber 50 . the holder 58 grips the well plate at its edges . the bottom of the holder 58 is empty , so as not to impede viewing of the "

"as discussed in the summary of the invention section , the present subject matter is particularly concerned with apparatus and methodologies for carrying out cathodic protection monitoring and testing combined with meter data collection via a common device over an advanced metering infrastructure ( ami ). currently , gas utilities must monitor the condition of their cathodic protection system on a regular basis . such monitoring is required by federal law , as well as by the utility to ensure the safety and longevity of the gas system . due to the number of cathodic protection test stations , and the fact they are related to maintenance , rather than billing , monitoring is typically accomplished manually . such labor intensive operation is an expense to the utility requiring extra vehicles and crews to be deployed into the utility territory . such operations may be required at a time when the utility is trying to reduce its vehicle usage to improve its environmental impact , but not having current cathodic protection data on a regular basis can lead to re - excavation of construction sites to repair compromised systems , as well as some deterioration of the buried pipes while the system is compromised . thus , it would be desirable to have in place a system and methodologies that may significantly reduce all costs involved with cathodic protection operation and monitoring . selected combinations of aspects of the disclosed technology correspond to a plurality of different embodiments of the present subject matter . it should be noted that each of the exemplary embodiments presented and discussed herein should not insinuate limitations of the present subject matter . features or steps illustrated or described as part of one embodiment may be used in combination with aspects of another embodiment to yield yet further embodiments . additionally , certain features may be interchanged with similar devices or features not expressly mentioned which perform the same or similar function . reference is made in detail to the presently preferred embodiments of the subject cathodic protection monitoring system . referring now to the drawings , fig1 illustrates an exemplary telemetry system generally 100 in accordance with the present subject matter . system 100 may include various exemplary telemetry endpoints 110 , 112 , 114 , and 116 located within , for example , a gas ami network , and which are read by network collectors 130 . telemetry endpoints may include , but are not limited to , a pressure monitor 110 , a data corrector 112 , cathodic protection apparatus 114 , and general telemetry apparatus 116 . such exemplary telemetry endpoints 110 , 112 , 114 , and 116 may be connected for data transmission via transmission paths 120 , 122 , 124 , and 126 , respectively , to collectors 130 . cathodic protection apparatus 114 , as noted further herein after , may correspond to a stand alone device or additional functionalities combined with gas metrology and endpoint communications devices in accordance with present technology . it should be appreciated that while transmission paths 120 , 122 , 124 , and 126 are presently illustrated as transmission lines , such is not a specific limitation of the present technology as data may be transmitted by any suitable technology , including via wired as well as wireless technology . in similar fashion , transmission paths 162 , 164 , 166 , and 168 ( illustrated as variously coupled data between head end associated items ) may also correspond to any suitable data transmission capable device or methodology , now existing or later developed . in accordance with present subject matter , the technology described herein is designed to reduce the operating costs associated with system integrity functions and the collection of consumption related information for gas utilities , and is thus not limited by the exemplary methodology and apparatus illustrated . those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the illustration in fig1 with respect to the network configuration is exemplary and that o","as used in this specification and in the appended claims , the term “ indicia ” broadly encompasses not only symbol patterns composed of alternating bars and spaces of various widths commonly referred to as bar code symbols , but also other one - or two - dimensional graphic patterns , as well as alphanumeric characters . in general , the term in “ indicia ” may apply to a type of pattern or information which may be recognized or identified by scanning a light beam and by detecting reflected or scattered light as a representation of variations in light reflectivity at various points of the pattern or information . a bar code symbol is one example of an “ indicia ” which the present invention can scan . as a preferred embodiment , the implementation of the present invention in a handheld reader 10 , as illustrated in fig1 , is described . the reader 10 includes a housing 12 having a handle 14 on which a trigger switch 16 is mounted . the housing includes a canopy above the handle , but removed for clarity from fig1 . a window module 18 is situated adjacent a front end of the housing . an optical module 20 is situated behind the window module 18 . a printed circuit board ( pcb ) 22 , whose front side is shown more clearly in fig2 , and whose rear side is shown more clearly in fig3 - 4 , is situated behind the optical module 20 at a rear end of the housing . the pcb slides into the handle 14 at an obtuse angle relative to a horizontal plane to accommodate the slanted - back slope of the handle . as shown in fig2 , a sensor 24 is mounted on the front side of the pcb . light returning from a symbol being read passes through the window module 18 through a collection lens and filter 26 in the lower part of the optical module 20 to the sensor 24 for detection . as described below , light from a light source passes through an aperture 28 in the pcb through another aperture 30 in the upper part of the optical module 20 and , in turn , through the window module 18 en route to the symbol for reflection therefrom . fig3 - 4 are similar , except that various supporting structures shown in fig3 have been removed to better see the components supported thereby . thus , as best seen in fig4 , a light source , such as a semiconductor laser 32 is mounted at the rear side of the pcb 22 and is operative for emitting a laser beam 34 horizontally through a focusing lens assembly 33 to a first scan mirror 36 for reflection upwardly to a second scan mirror for reflection forwardly through the aperture 28 . the first scan mirror 36 is , as described more fully below , mounted for reciprocal oscillation by a first motor drive 40 operating in a self -

"the &# 34 ; process and apparatus for distributed wide range leak detection , location and alarm for pollutants &# 34 ; provides continual monitoring , direct detection and location of a wide range of all sizes of leaks , from small leaks to medium and large leaks . it provides quick detection time . it provides constant direct testing for the presence of pollutants from medium and large leaks in an uninterrupted flow of test media within one sensor tube , while concurrently and alternately performing periodic cycle testing for the presence of diffusion from medium and small leaks in the other sensor tube . the system provides continual testing of the flow of test media from one of the sensor tubes while concurrently , and alternately , continual testing for presence of small amounts of pollutants from diffusion . the subject invention uses two sensor tubes . two sensor tubes are arranged substantially parallel , along the path and in vicinity of the pipe line , tanks or fuel systems to be monitored . while one sensor tube is being continually pumped with its test media flowing past the sensing device , the other sensor is alternately lying dormant for selected periods of time , for receiving incoming diffusion of vapors from medium and low level leaks . each sensor tube is a hollow conduit , typically about one - half inch internal diameter , constructed to permit diffusion of liquid , vapors or gaseous substances to enter thereinto through the walls of the conduit . ordinary industrial conduit , such as polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) or equivalent types well known in the industry , will be useful for this purpose and will be constructed to have openings in the walls to permit entrance of diffused gases , such as holes , slots or pores , and alternately may be of a sealed semipermeable membrane , such as ethylene vinyl acetate ( eva ) tubing . this type of membrane will allow vapors to pass through but blocks liquids . in a preferred embodiment , the sensor tube will be of a patented design constructed in three layers with a perforated inner support tube , covered by a layer of semipermeable membrane , and the two covered with an outer protective mesh sheath to inhibit physical damage to the tube . the elements of the subject invention include two sensor tubes ; a pump ; a sensor detector ; a control valve for alternately directing flow of test medium from either of the sensor tubes , and a system of instrumentation , controls and computer . the test medium in the preferred embodiment is standing air , and alternatively may be water or other inert liquid or gas to absorb vapors , gases or radiation from pollutants and convey them past a sensor for testing . the sensor detector is sensitive to the presence of pollutants that may be found in the test medium . the pump is used to displace and move the test medium through the sensor tubes ; and past the sensor detector . fig1 shows two sensor tubes 1 and 2 located along the path of the pipeline 3 to be monitored . the pump 4 and sensors 5 will be typically located at one end . although not essential , an intake filter and dryer 6 may be installed to prevent the entrance of moisture or other contaminants into the test medium . fig2 is a functional diagram of two sensor tubes 1 and 2 located along pipe line 3 , with pump 4 and sensor detector 5 located at one end , and with dryers 6 located at intakes of sensor tubes 1 and 2 . test medium 7 is contained within sensor tubes 1 and 2 . control valve 8 is shown for alternate , sequential direction of flow from , either one of the sensor tubes i and 2 to the sensor 5 . a small leak 9 and a small leak 10 are shown in the pipe line 3 , emitting gas , vapors or radiation from escaping pollutants . fig3 shows construction of a preferred embodiment of the sensor tube hollow conduit 16 , of a patented design , using semipermeable membrane 14 which allows vapors to pass through the walls and into the conduit but blocks liquids . the inner tube 12 , with perforations 13 in the walls thereof , is a hollow , perforated conduit 12 which transpor","fig2 shows a cable of tubes 1 terminating in connector 2 , and second cable of tubes 1 ′ terminating in connector 2 ′. connecting part 3 links the two connectors thereby joining the cables . fig3 illustrates the separated components of the connector , and the connecting part . the connector comprises a first part for receiving and clamping onto a cable of tubes ( comprising gland body 4 a and cable adapter 4 b ), a spreader 5 , and a connecting part 3 . cable gripping gland 4 clamps onto a cable of tubes 1 ( as shown in fig3 a ). the tubes are then separated by spreader 5 ( as shown in fig3 b ). spreader 5 guides each tube into a channel to align with a particular channel in tube seating body 6 a . the separated tubes then pass through individual channels in tube seating body 6 a . the channels of the tube seating body 6 a decrease in diameter at a point such that a shoulder is formed on which the terminal ends of the tubes sit . tube seating body 6 a and male plug 6 b interface with connecting part 3 . this arrangement ensures that each tube is connected sealingly to the next inline tube via tube seating body 6 a and connecting part 3 . a sealing means 8 is provided between the spreader 5 and tube seating body 6 a , and between male plug 6 b and connecting part 3 . the connecting part 3 links one connector to another , or to a device . the connection is made secure by connector locking ring 7 . once assembled , connector shell 10 houses spreader 5 , sealing means 8 , tube seating body 6 a , male plug 6 b , and sealing means 9 . as illustrated in fig3 a , cable gripping gland 4 comprises gland body 4 a and cable adapter 4 b . in operation , gland body 4 a is pushed over cable of tubes 1 , cable adapter 4 b is pushed over the exposed tubes 1 a and onto the sheath up to cable sheath butt 11 , gland body 4 a is then moved over cable adapter 4 b until a tight fit is achieved . a significant advantage provided by the design of cable gripping gland 4 is that the greater the pulling force on cable of tubes 1 in a direction towards cable adapter 4 b , the tighter the grip between cable adapter 4 b and cable of tubes 1 ( up to a point of failure ). the spreader 5 is shown in greater detail in fig3 b . this figure illustrates a three part spreader to be used for a thirty - one tube cable comprising four layers of tubes . one tube of each layer is illustrated in the figure ( tube 15 for the outer tube layer , tube 16 for the intermediate tube layer , tube 17 for the inner tube layer , and single tube 18 central to cable 1 constituting the central layer ). each of the spreader parts is provided with guideways to urge each tube towards a particular hole . as illustrated by fig3 b , the guideways are formed by a number of continuous walls provided on the spreader , the space between two walls defining a channel slightly wider than an individual tube . once the sheath of cable 1 has been stripped to reveal individual tubes , outer spreader part 5 a is inserted between the outer tube layer 15 and intermediate tube layer 16 . the twelve individual tubes of the outer layer are guided along the guideways into the twelve equidistant holes in outer spreader part 5 a . outer spreader part 5 a is pushed down the tubes to a set distance from the multi - tube cable sheath butt 11 . a keyway 12 can be provided to align outer spreader part 5 a with gland body 4 a if necessary . intermediate spreader part 5 b is then inserted between intermediate tube layer 16 and inner tube layer 17 . the twelve individual tubes of the intermediate layer are guided along the guideways into the twelve equidistant holes in the intermediate spreader part 5 b . intermediate spreader part 5 b is then pushed down the tubes and into outer spreader part 5 a . a keyway 13 is provided for alignment of intermediate spreader part 5 b into outer spreader part 5 a . central tube 18 of the multi - tube cable is then inserted into the hole at the centre of inner spreader part 5 c . the six individual tubes of the inner layer are guided along the guideways into the remaining six e"

contact thermistor , respectively . two types of thermistor can be used in the first embodiment . the first is a contact type ( fig1 a ) where signal lines connected to a temperature - sensing element 79 are electrically continuous with base plates 80 a and 80 b that support the temperature - sensing element 79 . the base plate 80 a and 80 are made of a resilient material . the second is a non - contact type where signal lines connected to a temperature - sensing element 79 are electrically isolated from a base plate 76 that supports the temperature - sensing element 79 . the base plate 76 is made of a resilient material . here , by way of the contact type thermistor 70 a , a description will be given of an example where the surface temperature of a fixing roller 64 that serves as a heat roller is detected . for this type of thermistor , the electrically conductive base plates 80 a and 80 b are used as both signal lines and reinforcing or supporting plates . a protection sheet 77 is formed of an insulating material to protect the temperature -

sensing element 79 and the base plates 80 a and 80 b . this causes the temperature - sensing element 79 to move out of contact with the fixing roller 64 . then , the base plate 80 a or 80 b moves into contact with the conductor 75 a or 75 b to close the switch 87 or 88 . when the paper jam has not occurred , the switches 87 and 88 are open and the voltage ( vt ) detected by an a / d converter 69 in the controller is given by where r 72 is the resistance of the resistor 72 , r 73 is the resistance of the resistor 73 , r ( t ) is the resistance of the temperature - sensing element 79 that reflects the surface temperature of the fixing roller 64 , and the numeral 5 denotes the supply voltage in volts for temperature detection . fig5 illustrates analog waveforms before and after the occurrence of paper jam . a high voltage is input to the a / d converter 69 when no paper jam occurs . when the switch 87 or 88 is closed due to the occurrence of paper jam , the voltage v ( t ) falls to 0 v . experiment was conducted to determine an input voltage to the a / d converter 69 when the fixing unit 63 operates normally , and an input voltage when the temperature -

"coupled dielectric resonators are used to create compact microphotonic filters . the dielectric resonator is usually a ring , a racetrack , a quarter - wave shifted grating or another type of dielectric microcavity . these filters are commonly designed by using resonators with identical uncoupled resonant frequencies ( prior art ). an uncoupled resonant frequency is the frequency experienced by a resonator when it isolated from its environment ( isolated from any other dielectric structure such as waveguides and resonators ). as the first embodiment of this invention , it is stated that these filters should be designed with resonators of different uncoupled resonator frequencies to take into account the mostly repeatable frequency shifts that occur when the resonators are coupled to their environment and the mostly repeatable frequency shifts coming from the fabrication process . precise modification of the resonant frequency of a resonator is usually done by employing impermanent mechanisms like thermal tuning or carrier injection tuning ( prior art ). these mechanisms require power consumption and a control circuit . in many cases a permanent modification is favored . in prior art , permanent mechanisms such as global thin film deposition , global etching , stress introduction and the photorefractive effect have been employed to tune the center frequency of complete filters and hence to mostly equally modify the resonances of all resonators forming the filter . in addition , stress induction and the photorefractive can only introduce small changes in resonant frequency . it is important to note that only thermal tuning has been used in prior art to change the resonant frequency of an individual resonator of a high - order filter . all the other mechanisms were employed to change the center frequency of a complete optical filter and not of its individual components . fabrication techniques to introduce precise and permanent modifications of resonant frequencies of individual dielectric microcavities are presented in this invention . these techniques can be applied to individual resonators within a high - order filter and to single resonators coupled to waveguides . introducing precise and permanent modifications to the resonant frequency of a dielectric resonator is a difficult problem , whose solutions are necessary in fabrication of filters formed of resonators with slightly different uncoupled resonant frequencies and for other applications . the importance of correcting frequency shifts will first be discussed . then , the fabrication techniques forming the other embodiments of the invention will be presented . in filter response synthesis , precise control of the resonance frequencies and mutual couplings is required . herein , a frequency shift in a resonator is identified as an effect that can hinder the realization of the desired response if left uncompensated . a frequency shift can originate from different phenomena that will now be described . first , a coupling - induced frequency shift ( cifs ) is due to the perturbation of a resonant mode , via the index of an external coupled structure that altering the resonant frequency . this is a purely optical effect and has nothing to do with the fabrication process employed . this frequency shift can be negative or positive depending on the dominant of several contributing effects . for a resonator perturbed by a nearby dielectric object with no relevant modes of its own , the cifs is negative for a positive index perturbation . this is an intuitive result if one considers the wave equation , or its stationary integral for frequency : a positive refractive index perturbation is introduced , so the frequency must decrease . in the case of adjacent evanescently - coupled resonators , however , the basis of modes employed to understand the coupled resonator is normally not orthogonal . a second , positive cifs contribution then arises due to the shared cross - energy of the modes and the net cifs could be found to be positive . other contributions arise form deformati","the present invention provides a method for measuring any parameter of interest in a particular sample using an eddy current probe . for example , the probe may be used to measure hydrogen concentration in a piece or section of metal , such as the hydrogen concentration in the cladding of a nuclear fuel rod . generally , the eddy current probe is calibrated using a calibration standard that provides varying amounts of the parameter of interest in a material or substrate that represents the sample to be measured . for example , the calibration standard may be a piece of metal having varying hydrogen concentrations similar to the piece of metal or sample to be measured . the calibrated probe is then used to measure the parameter of interest in a given sample . fig1 is a process flow diagram according to one embodiment of the present invention . fig1 provides an overview of one embodiment of a process that may be followed to obtain a measurement of hydrogen concentration in metal . the process is described in the context of measurement of hydrogen in nuclear fuel rod claddings . in this embodiment , the fuel rods will preferably be located in a fuel storage pool , which is filled with water . however , the present invention is not limited to either the measurement of hydrogen concentration or to nuclear fuel rods , nor is it limited to use in aqueous systems or any other type of environment . the invention is also discussed in a certain order of operation . the order of operation is not critical , and the invention is not limited to the order presented . at step 110 , a probe attached to an eddy current measurement device is brought into contact with a calibration standard . the eddy current probe used in this invention is preferably a surface probe . the probe should contact the surface in a reproducible manner to prevent a decrease in sensitivity due to inadequate contact with the surface . preferably , contacting the surface in a reproducible manner is accomplished through the use of spring - loading , which provides constant pressure sensor - to - surface contact . additionally , the probe will preferably be oriented perpendicular to the surface of the calibration standard with little or no variation from the perpendicular direction . also , the area ( s ) selected for measurement should be as similar as possible in geometry to each other . differences in geometry such as curves , edges or other types of discontinuities may affect eddy current response and lead to errors in concentration measurement . in addition to geometric or positioning sources of error , there are other typical material conditions that may lead to variable eddy current response that may obscure the response from the hydrogen concentration . typical sources of background include : 1 ) variation in zirconium oxide thickness , ( 2 ) ferromagnetic and non ferromagnetic crud thickness , ( 3 ) variation in the crud magnetic permeability , ( 4 ) variation in hydrogen concentration across the cladding wall , and ( 5 ) variation in cladding temperature . these material conditions should be accounted for when preparing the calibration samples . these factors may be accounted for by using a calibration standard that replicates as closely as possible whichever of these factors will be present in the actual sample to be measured . at step 115 , the calibration standard is measured at a predetermined number of frequencies and locations , where each location contains a known level of the parameter of interest and representative values of the background variables . as discussed in more detail below , the calibration standard would have varying levels of the parameter of interest extending beyond the range expected in the in - situ measurements , as well as having representative levels of background variables that may affect the measurement of the sample . when measured , the eddy current probe response is dependent upon the electrical conductivity of the calibration standard , which , in turn , is dependent upon the level of the parameter of interest in the standa"

"fig1 illustrates the use of a swing speed timer 10 by a golfer 11 , according to certain principles of the present invention . the embodiment of the timer 10 that is illustrated in fig1 is configured to measure the duration of the swing of a golf club 12 . in certain embodiments , the timer 10 is also configured to measure the peak speed of the club head 13 of the golf club 12 . when the club 12 is swung by the golfer 1 , the peak speed of the club head 13 typically occurs at approximately the moment of impact of the club head 13 with a golf ball 14 , or , in the case of a practice swing without a golf ball 14 present , when the club head 13 passes over the point 15 on a tee 16 , or on the ground at which the golf ball 14 would normally be located . a diagram of an embodiment of the architecture of the timer 10 is illustrated in fig2 . it includes a transmitter / receiver 20 to which is connected a transmit / receive antenna 21 from which a signal is transmitted and to which a signal is received from a moving object such as the club head 13 . the timer 10 includes a speed signal detector 22 that detects a speed signal from the moving object at an input connected to the transmitter / receiver 20 , a processor 23 that interprets and further processes the speed signal , a timing unit 24 , and an annunciator 25 . when a portion of a transmitted continuous wave signal is reflected from a club head 13 that is moving toward or away from the antenna 21 , the received signal can contain a doppler shift that is proportional to the frequency of the transmitted signal and the velocity of the club head 13 toward or away from the antenna 21 , as in the timer embodiment 10 a of fig3 . in the timer 10 a , detector 22 a , which has an input connected to the transmitter / receiver 20 , detects the amount of the doppler shift between the transmitted and doppler - shifted received signals and outputs a doppler signal to the processor 23 , which may be a microprocessor 23 a . the processor 23 a derives information from the doppler signal and correlates it with information from a timing unit 24 a to measure the duration of the swing of the club 12 by the golfer 11 . the microprocessor 23 a outputs signals to the annunciator 25 . the processor 23 may also derive the speed of the club head 13 and output it to the annunciator 25 . the transmitter / receiver 20 is one that transmits and receives a signal that is capable of capturing the speed of the club head 13 . preferably , it transmits and receives a continuous wave signal from which the speed of the club head can be captured by returning a doppler signal . the continuous wave signal may be an ultrasonic signal , an electromagnetic signal or some other continuous wave signal . in fig3 , the embodiment of the timer 10 a that is illustrated has a transmitter / receiver 20 a that transmits and receives an rf signal , of which c - band and x - band signals are practical examples . the annunciator 25 is one that converts an output signal received over a wired or wireless link from the processor 23 into a form for use or interpretation . in its simplest and most useful form , annunciator 25 converts the outputs into an audible or visual representation perceivable by the golfer 11 . in the embodiment of fig3 , the annunciator is an lcd display 25 a on which the swing duration of the club head 13 is displayed to the golfer 11 as a direct and immediate measurement of each swing of the golf club 12 by the golfer 11 . the processor 23 in the embodiment of fig3 is a microprocessor 23 a that is capable of interpreting the doppler signal from the detector 22 to determine whether or not an object , namely the club head 13 , in the field of the antenna 21 is moving , and if so at what speed . the interpretation that the club head 13 is moving is used to determine that the club head 13 is being pulled back from the ball 14 or point 15 , and hence that a swing has begun . this determination is used by the processor 23 to start the timing circuit 24 to time the swing of the club 12 . the interpretation that the","with reference to the figures generally , exemplary embodiments of a method and a photo resist coater tool system 1 for photo resist dispensing according to the invention are now described . as shown in fig1 , the photo resist coater tool system 1 includes a movable dispensing nozzle 2 having a nozzle tip 4 for dispensing fluid . movement of the dispensing nozzle 2 is effected by a nozzle positioning mechanism 3 . the system may be configured to have multiple nozzles such as nozzle 2 . for simplicity , only one such nozzle 2 is shown while it is to be understood that the principles of this invention may be applied to multiple nozzles in photo resist coater tools . a switching mechanism , such as a valve 20 , is positioned to selectively control flow of fluid through dispensing nozzle 2 to the nozzle tip 4 . the valve 20 is conventional and may be of the electronic , electromagnetic , pneumatic or hydraulic type and is shown as a three - way valve . a first input port 21 of the valve 20 is connected to a photo resist flow line 22 which can send photo resist 29 to the dispensing nozzle 2 from a photo resist source 24 . an in - line photo resist pump 26 facilitates the transfer of photo resist . a second input port 23 to the valve 20 is connected to a solvent flow line 18 along which solvent 19 is sent to the dispensing nozzle 2 from a solvent source 14 via an in - line solvent pump 16 . an output port 27 of the valve 20 is connected to the dispensing nozzle 2 to selectively dispense photo resist 29 or solvent 19 through the nozzle tip 4 depending on which of the input ports 21 , 23 the valve 20 is configured to receive fluid from . a main controller 6 is configured to effect the movement of the dispensing nozzle 2 through communication with the nozzle positioning mechanism 3 and to control the input of fluid through one of the input ports 21 , 23 of the valve 20 . the main controller 6 also controls the activation of the solvent pump 16 and the photo resist pump 24 through communication with the pump controller 12 . a valve control line 33 indicates communication from the main controller 6 to the valve 20 , while a positioning control line 34 indicates communication from the main controller 6 to the nozzle positioning mechanism 3 . a pump control line 35 indicates communication from the main controller 6 to the pump controller 12 . photo resist pump control line 36 and solvent pump control line 37 indicate communication between photo resist pump 26 and the solvent pump 16 to the pump controller 12 . referring next to the schematic view of fig2 , alternate positions of the dispensing nozzle 2 are illustrated . the dispensing nozzle 2 will typically be in a production position 8 ( illustrated with phantom lines ) for dispensing photo resist 29 on to a semiconductor wafer 25 positioned on a coater plate 28 . when the production photo resist dispensing process is complete , the dispensing nozzle 2 is rotated to an idle position 10 over a solvent drain 30 . dispensing nozzle rotation is effected about axis 38 by the nozzle positioning mechanism 3 as illustrated by the arrows numbered 40 and 42 . again , referring to fig1 , when a production photo resist dispensing step is about to occur , the main controller 6 directs the nozzle positioning mechanism 3 to position the dispensing nozzle 2 over a semiconductor wafer 25 positioned on coater plate 28 . the main controller 6 then actuates the valve 20 to receive input fluid from the photo resist flow line 22 and , via the pump controller 12 , activates the photo resist pump 26 to send photo resist 29 from the photo resist source 24 through the photo resist flow line 22 through valve 20 to the nozzle tip 4 to be dispensed on to the wafer 25 . when the dispensing nozzle 2 has completed a production photo resist dispensing operation , the main controller 6 signals the pump controller 12 to stop sending photo resist 29 and close the input 21 to valve 20 . the main controller then activates the nozzle positioning mechanism 3 to rotate the dispensing nozzle 2 to the idle position 10 over "
"fig1 shows an immersion lithography apparatus 100 to which cleaning methods and systems of this invention may be applied . as shown in fig1 , the immersion lithography apparatus 100 comprises an illuminator optical unit 1 including a light source such as an excimer laser unit , an optical integrator ( or homogenizer ) and a lens and serving to emit pulsed ultraviolet light il with wavelength 248 nm to be made incident to a pattern on a reticle r . the pattern on the reticle r is projected onto a wafer w coated with a photoresist at a specified magnification ( such as ¼ or ⅕ ) through a telecentric light projection unit pl . the pulsed light il may alternatively be arf excimer laser light with wavelength 193 nm , f 2 laser light with wavelength 157 nm or the i -

stage optical element ( such as a lens ) 4 disposed opposite to the wafer w and a cylindrical housing 3 containing the rest of its components . the reticle r is supported on a reticle stage rst incorporating a mechanism for moving the reticle r in the x - direction , the y - direction and the rotary direction around the z - axis . the two - dimensional position and orientation of the reticle r on the reticle stage rst are detected by a laser interferometer ( not shown ) in real time and the positioning of the reticle r is affected by a main control unit 14 on the basis of the detection thus made . the wafer w is held by a wafer holder ( not shown ) on a z - stage 9 for controlling the focusing position ( along the z - axis ) and the tilting angle of the wafer w . the z - stage 9 is affixed to an xy - stage 10 adapted to move in the xy - plane substantially parallel to the image - forming surface of the light projection unit pl . the xy - stage 10 is set on a base 11 . thus , the z - stage 9 serves to match the wafer surface with the image surface of the light projection unit pl by adjusting the focusing position ( along the z - axis ) and the tilting angle of the wafer w by the auto - focusing and auto - leveling method , and the xy - stage 10 serves to adjust the position of the wafer w in the x - direction and the y - direction . the two - dimensional position and orientation of the z - stage 9 ( and hence also of the wafer w ) are monitored in real time by another laser interferometer 13 with reference to a mobile mirror 12 affixed to the z - stage 9 . control data based on the results of this monitoring are transmitted from the main control unit 14 to a stage - driving unit 15 adapted to control the motions of the z - stage 9 and the xy - stage 10 according to the received control data . at the time of an exposure , the projection light is made to sequentially move from one to another of different exposure positions on the wafer w according to the pattern on the reticle r in a step - and - repeat routine or in a step - and - scan routine . the lithography apparatus 100 described with reference to fig1 is an immersion lithography apparatus and is hence adapted to have a liquid ( or the “ immersion liquid ”) 7 of a specified kind such as water filling the space ( the “ gap ”) between the surface of the wafer w and the lower surface of the last - stage optical element 4 of the light projection unit pl at least while the pattern image of the reticle r is being projected onto the wafer w . the last - stage optical element 4 of the light projection unit pl may be detachably affixed to the cylindrical housing 3 and is designed such that the liquid 7 will contact only the last - stage optical element 4 and not the cylindrical housing 3 because the housing 3 typically comprises a metallic material and is likely to become corroded . the liquid 7 is supplied from a liquid supply unit 5 that may comp","the preferred embodiments of the present invention are directed to automating the process of entering cases in a help -
